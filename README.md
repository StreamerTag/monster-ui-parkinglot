# Parking Lot for Monster-UI

This app allows you to view and pickup parked calls, by clicking them on the screen.

You can also see and call the person who parked the call.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your Monster UI apps directory, often /var/www/html/monster-ui, then you may register the app on KAZOO with a sup command:

```sup crossbar_maintenance init_app '/var/www/html/monster-ui/apps/parkinglot' 'http://myapidns.tld:8000/v2'```
